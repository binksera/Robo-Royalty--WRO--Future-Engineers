Robo-Royalty
====

Robo-royalty is a multi-collaborated rover that is provided with 2 sensors, a steering system, an engine system that ensures mobility to be adequately sub-divided within its various components, allowing satisfactory motor utilization. With these materials, this allows the concept of AI and robotics to be propagated and assimilated within the various proponents of society, such as; students, institutionalized and government sectors, and denizens of the ever-changing civilization we reside in.

## Engineering Materials:

 - Blocks from lego

-The purpose of LEGO blocks in an EV3 robot is to provide modular and customizable components for building the robot's physical structure and mechanical systems, enabling the creation of functional and adaptable robots while fostering creativity and learning in robotics and engineering.

 - 3 hole brick

-The purpose of the 3-hole bricks in an EV3 robot is to provide versatile attachment points for connecting various components, enabling the creation of complex mechanical structures and mechanisms.

 - 15 hole brick

-The purpose of the 15-hole bricks in an EV3 robot is to offer a larger and more flexible platform for constructing extended mechanical frameworks, accommodating the integration of multiple components and enhancing the robot's structural stability.

 - Wheels

-The purpose of the wheels in an EV3 robot is to facilitate smooth and controlled movement, allowing the robot to navigate its environment effectively.

 - Gyro

-The purpose of the gyro sensor in an EV3 robot is to measure and provide data about the robot's orientation and rotation, aiding in precise navigation and movement control.

 - Color sensor

-The purpose of the color sensor in an EV3 robot is to detect and identify colors in its surroundings, enabling tasks such as line-following, color sorting, and recognizing specific objects.

 - Ultrasonic sensor

-The purpose of the ultrasonic sensor in an EV3 robot is to measure distances to objects by emitting sound waves and detecting their reflections, enabling the robot to navigate, avoid obstacles, and interact with its environment based on proximity.

 - Servo Motor 

-The purpose of the servo motor in an EV3 robot is to provide precise control over rotational movement, allowing the robot to articulate specific mechanisms, such as arms or grippers, with accuracy.

**Mobility Management**

The motors that were curated for utilization and ensure to provide power for the rear wheel-drive are the L-servo motors, due to their size and capability to produce a large amount of rotational force. Allowing the machine to move efficiently.Whereas, M-servo motors were used for their small size, to be the one to operate the steering system, which provides itself with materials such as screws and gears to produce lateral motion.
	Furthermore, the chassis design was built upon the size of the motor, to be fit in the measurement threshold. While ensuring compromise was not a part of said system. This also allowed the production of space for the sensors.
	Lastly, the differential was added to the rear wheel-drive axle, to make the 2 wheels be able to spin independently of each other, allowing the movement to be efficient, while avoiding any complex strains that would compromise machine mobility.

**Power and Sense Management**

What acted as the central processing unit of the machine, was the EV3 brick unit. Which powered all the sensors and motors, therefore allocating sufficient power for the robot. This was centralized, in order to avoid any entanglement from various cables, and to provide a compliment structure with one another. 
	There are 3 main sensors which were utilized, the gyro, which detected the rate of change of angle in the robot. An ultrasonic sensor, for distance and detecting objects within the vicinity. Lastly, a color sensor that is used to distinguish the different colors found in the mat.

**Obstacle Management**

Ultrasonic sensors and color sensors were taken into consideration in order for the obstacle avoidance to occur. Using both, to detect an object and its color to do adequate commands, set forth by the code that would be used in the contest proper. When the ultrasonic sensor is not able to procure data, the color sensor situated underneath the machine, acts as a viable substitute. For detection of different marks found in the field, ensuring actions correspond to the value detected.
